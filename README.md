# What is Proof of Existence? 

Proof of Existence is a service that verifies the existence of a document or file at a specific time via timestamped transactions. PoE utilizes the one-way nature of cryptographic hash functions to reduce the amount of information that needs to be stored on the blockchain.

In this walkthrough, we are going to introduce some basic Ethereum smart contract development best practices by creating a simple proof of existence contract and interacting with it on the blockchain.

## Set up the Environment

### Connect to a Blockchain
To develop Ethereum applications, you will need a client to connect to an Ethereum blockchain. You can use [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth), [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) or a development blockchain such as [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/). 

In this walkthrough we will be using the Ganache command line interface, ganache-cli. You can find the documentation on ganache-cli [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

You can install ganache-cli with the following command: 
```
$ sudo npm install -g ganache-cli
```
And start ganache-cli with
```
$ ganache-cli
```
When ganache-cli starts, you can see that it starts with 10 accounts. Each of those accounts comes prefunded with Ether so we do not need to mine or acquire funds from a faucet.

Ganache-cli starts a development blockchain that needs to be running while develop the application so leave it running while we continue working on the application.

### Truffle Development Framework

Solidity is the most popular programming language for writing smart contracts in Ethereum. We will be using Solidity throughout this course.

[The Truffle development framework](http://truffleframework.com/) is one of the most popular development tools for writing Solidity smart contracts for Ethereum. Truffle will help us compile, deploy and test our smart contracts once they are written.

To install truffle
```
$ sudo npm install -g truffle
```
Create a project directory and set up truffle
```
$ mkdir proof-of-existence
$ cd proof-of-existence/
$ truffle init
```
Truffle sets up a contracts directory where we will write our contracts, a migrations directory where we will write scripts to deploy our contracts and a test directory where we will write tests to make sure that our contracts work as expected. 

The project also comes with truffle-config.js and truffle.js configuration files. These files serve the same purpose, but the project initializes with both because of naming conflicts on Windows machines. We will use truffle-config.js, so you can delete truffle.js. In truffle-config.js we need to specify the network that we will be using.

In the module.exports object, add the following information:
```
module.exports = {
	networks: {
		development: {
			host: “localhost”,
			port: 8545,
			network_id: “*”
		}
    }
};
```
We use this information because ganache-cli is running our development blockchain on localhost:8545, and this is what we want to connect to. Specifying *network_id* as * means that any truffle will deploy to any network running at localhost:8545.

Truffle comes with a Migrations.sol contract that keeps track our migrations as well as a 1_initial_migrations.js script to deploy the Migrations.sol contract.

Run the following command in the terminal in your project directory:
```
$ truffle migrate
```
The terminal should print “Using network ‘development’. Network up to date.”

This means that you environment is set up correctly and we can move on to writing our smart contracts.

## Writing the Smart Contract

Run the following command in the terminal in your project directory:
```
$ truffle create contract ProofOfExistence1
```
This command will create a Solidity file in the contracts directory called “ProofOfExistence1.sol” and set up the boilerplate code for the contract, a contract definition and a contract constructor. Open ProofOfExistence.sol in your text editor.

Update your ProofOfExistence1.sol file so that it looks like [this](./contracts/ProofOfExistence1.sol).

We are starting with something simple, but incorrect and we are going to work towards a better contract.

Our contract has a state and two functions. This contract actually has two different kinds of functions, a transactional function (notarize) and a read-only, or _view_, function (proofFor). Transactional functions can modify state whereas constant functions can only read the state and return values.

Let’s deploy this contract to our test network.

Create a new migrations file in the migrations directory called 2_deploy_contracts.js. In this file add the following:
```javascript
var ProofOfExistence1 = artifacts.require("./ProofOfExistence1.sol");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(ProofOfExistence1);
};
```
This script tells Truffle to get the contract information from ProofOfExitence.sol and deploy it to the specified network. Now we just need to tell Truffle to run the deployment.

Run the following command in the terminal in your project directory:
```
$ truffle migrate
```
In the terminal output you should see that Truffle compiled ProofOfExistence.sol and printed some warning regarding the contract. Then it runs the migrations using the network ‘development’ that we specified in truffle-config.js.

Truffle remembers which contracts it has migrated to the network, so if we want to run the migration again on the same network, we need to use the --reset option like so: 
```
$ truffle migrate --reset
```
You can find more information about truffle migrations [here](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations).

## Interacting with your Smart Contract

Our contract is now on the development blockchain, so we can interact with it. We can read the contract state from the blockchain and update the state by calling  the notarize function. We can do this using the Truffle console.

Bring up the truffle console with the command:
```
$truffle console
```
You should see
```
truffle(development)>
```
On the first line enter:
```
var poe = await ProofOfExistence1.at(ProofOfExistence1.address)
```
This line says that the variable “poe” is an instance of ProofOfExistence1.sol found at the address that we just deployed.

You can see the address by entering
```
truffle(development)> poe.address
'0xc490df1850010ea8146c1dd3e961fedbf6b85bef'
```
To call the notarize function, we call it like any other javascript function.
```
truffle(development)> poe.notarize(‘Hello World!’)
{ tx: '0x60ae...2643cbea65',
  receipt: …
}
```
This function causes a state change, so it is a transactional function. Transactional functions return a Promise that resolves to a transaction object. 

We can get the proof for the string with
```
truffle(development)> poe.proofFor(‘Hello World!’)
‘0x7f83b...126d9069’
```
And check that the contract’s state was correctly changed
```
truffle(development)> poe.proof()
‘0x7f83b...126d9069’
```
The hashes match!

## Iterating the code

Our contract works! But it can only store one proof at a time. Let’s change that.

Exit the Truffle console and create a new file called ProofOfExistence2.sol:
```
truffle(development)> .exit
$ truffle create contract ProofOfExistence2
```
Update the ProofOfExistence2 contract to match [this contract](./contracts/ProofOfExistence2.sol). 

The main changes between the first version and this version are that we changed the “proof” variable to a bytes32 array called “proofs” and made it private. We also added a function called “hasProof” to check if a proof has already been stored in the array.

Update the migration script 2_deploy_contracts.js to deploy the new contract and deploy it to the development blockchain.
```
$ truffle migrate --reset
```
Launch the console to interact with the new contract.
```
$ truffle console
```
Save the deployed contract
```
truffle(development)> var poe = await ProofOfExistence2.at(ProofOfExistence2.address)
```
We can check for a proof.
```
truffle(development)> poe.checkDocument(“Hello World!”)
false
```
It returns false because we haven’t added anything yet. Let’s do that now.
```
truffle(development)> poe.notarize(“Hello World!”)
{ tx: '0xd6f72...10a6e',
  receipt: 
   { transactionHash: ...
  logs: [] }

truffle(development)> poe.checkDocument(“Hello World!”)
true
```
We can check to make sure that our contract will store multiple proofs.
```
truffle(development)> poe.notarize(“Hello Consensys!”)
{ tx: '0x8b566...091ace',
  receipt: 
   { transactionHash: ...
  logs: [] }

truffle(development)> poe.checkDocument(“Hello Consensys!”)
True
```
Looping over arrays in smart contracts can get expensive as arrays get longer. Using a mapping is a better solution.

Let’s create a final version in ProofOfExistence3.sol using mappings. You can use [this code](./contracts/ProofOfExistence3.sol) for the contract.

Modify the deployment script to deploy the new contract and test it in the console to make sure that it behaves just like ProofOfExistence2.sol.

## Deploying to the Testnet

From here, we are going to deviate from the Zeppelin Solutions walkthrough. If you want to learn how to deploy contracts using the geth console (which requires syncing with the testnet), you can consult the Zeppelin Solutions walkthrough.

The first step in our alternate deployment method is to get an Ethereum account on Metamask. On the landing page, click “Get Chrome Extension.”

Once the extension is installed, accept the terms of use and enter a password for your account. 

You will be shown 12 words that can be used to restore your wallet. A word of caution, do NOT publish these words anywhere public. Anyone that has these 12 words has access to your wallet. Save these 12 words in a variable called mnemonic in your truffle-config.js file. 
```javascript
// truffle-config.js
var mnemonic = “amateur fan ... insect police”
```
Truffle will use these words to access your wallet and deploy the contract.

Deploying the contract requires us to make a transaction on the testnet, so we need some ether to pay for the transaction. You can get free Rinkeby ether by going to [this website](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) and following the instructions. Make sure you enter the Ethereum address for your 1st Metamask account.


Now that we have a testnet account with Ether, we need to configure Truffle to be able to deploy the contract.

To deploy contracts to the testnet using Truffle without having to sync a local node, you can use Infura. Infura allows you to access a fully synced Ethereum node via their API. We will use their API to deploy our contracts to the Rinkeby testnet.

Go to the [Infura website](https://infura.io/) and sign up for a free account. Save the Rinkeby test network URL that Infrua provides in a variable called infura in truffle-config.js.
```javascript
// truffle-config.js
var infura = "https://rinkeby.infura.io/Umc...8z"
```
For Truffle to derive our ethereum address from the mnemonic, we need to install the Truffle HD wallet provider. In the terminal located in the proof-of-existence project root run:
```
$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
```
And import the HD wallet provider into your truffle-config.js file.
```javascript
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider")
```
Now we just need to add the rinkeby network configuration to the networks object in truffle-config.js module.exports.

Change the module.exports object to resemble this: 
```javascript
  networks: {
      development: {
          host: "localhost",
          port: 8545,
          network_id: "*"
      },
      rinkeby: {
          provider: new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, infura),
          network_id: "4",
	  gas: 4500000
      }
  }
```  
Where the “mnemonic” variable is the 12 word seed phrase that you saved from metamask and the “infura” variable is your infura API endpoint URL.

You just have to run “truffle migrate” for the correct network and your contract will be deployed!
```
$ truffle migrate --network rinkeby

Using network 'rinkeby'.

The terminal prints the addresses of the deployed contracts as well as the transaction hashes of the deployment transactions. This information can also be referenced in the contract artifacts, which are stored in proof-of-existence/build/contracts/. Deployment information is found at the bottom of each JSON file.
